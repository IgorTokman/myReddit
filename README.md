# myReddit

Hybrid mobile application that is the prototype of [Reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android).

Reddit is a source for what's new and popular on the web. Users like you provide all of the content and decide, through voting, what's good and what's junk.
Links that receive community approval bubble up towards #1, so the front page is constantly in motion and (hopefully) filled with fresh, interesting links.
